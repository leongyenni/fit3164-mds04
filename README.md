# Stock Market Forecasting Application

## Motivation
Our project is motivated by the application of cutting-edge meta-learning models to enhance stock market forecasting. Meta-learning, which involves "learning to learn," empowers these models to adapt to new, unseen tasks by drawing on their extensive training across various domains. This adaptability is particularly valuable in the unpredictable and dynamic world of stock markets. Our project aims to provide investors and analysts with more robust, adaptable, and accurate tools for making informed investment decisions.

Meta-Learning Model Implemented:
N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series Forecasting) Model + RevIN (Reversible Instance Normalization and Denormalization) Layers
